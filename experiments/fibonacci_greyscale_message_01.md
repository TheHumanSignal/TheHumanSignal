## ðŸ§ª Objective

To demonstrate a simple grayscale-to-ASCII encoding method based on selecting pixel brightness values from blocks located at Fibonacci positions in a 13-block horizontal grayscale gradient image.

---

## ðŸ”¢ Method

1. A 13-block grayscale image is created, where brightness increases gradually from left (dark) to right (bright).
2. Grayscale values (0â€“255) are extracted from the blocks at positions:
   - 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13  
   (These correspond to the first few Fibonacci numbers.)
3. Each grayscale value is directly mapped to an ASCII character.

## ðŸŽ¯ Input Values (Grayscale to ASCII)

| Position | Grayscale Value | ASCII Char |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 2        | 72               | H           |
| 3        | 101              | e           |
| 5        | 108              | l           |
| 8        | 108              | l           |
| 13       | 111              | o           |

## ðŸ§  Notes

- The success of this decoding confirms the grayscale blocks were uniformly scaled and the Fibonacci-indexed sampling strategy is valid.
- This method can be reused in further experiments with altered patterns or different index functions (e.g., prime numbers, Lucas sequence, etc.).
